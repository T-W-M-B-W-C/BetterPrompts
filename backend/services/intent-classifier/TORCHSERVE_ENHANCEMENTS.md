# TorchServe Client Production Enhancements

## Summary of Enhancements

The TorchServe client has been enhanced with production-ready features following backend development best practices.

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Purpose**: Prevent cascading failures when TorchServe is unavailable
- **Configuration**: 
  - Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
  - Recovery timeout: 60 seconds (configurable)
  - Automatic reset after recovery timeout
- **Benefits**: Protects the system from repeated failed requests, allows time for recovery

### 2. Advanced Health Checking
- **Features**:
  - Cached health checks to reduce overhead (30-second cache)
  - Configurable health check intervals
  - Automatic health status tracking
  - Integration with circuit breaker
- **Metrics**: Health status exposed via Prometheus gauge

### 3. Comprehensive Metrics
- **Prometheus Metrics Added**:
  - `torchserve_requests_total`: Request count by method and status
  - `torchserve_request_duration_seconds`: Request latency histogram
  - `torchserve_connection_status`: Connection health (0/1)
  - `torchserve_retry_total`: Retry attempts counter
- **Benefits**: Full observability into TorchServe integration performance

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Input Validation**: 
  - Text length limits based on model capacity
  - Type checking for inputs
  - Batch size limiting
- **Retry Logic**: 
  - Exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Configurable retry attempts
  - Retry metrics tracking
- **Error Types**:
  - `TorchServeConnectionError`: Network/connection issues
  - `TorchServeInferenceError`: Model inference failures

### 5. Batch Processing Improvements
- **Features**:
  - Automatic batch size limiting based on configuration
  - Metadata enrichment for each batch item
  - Performance metrics per batch
- **Safety**: Prevents memory overflow from oversized batches

### 6. Configuration Management
- **New Settings**:
  ```env
  CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
  CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=60
  HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
  HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=5
  ```
- **Benefits**: Easy tuning for different environments

### 7. Model Information API
- **New Method**: `get_model_info()` for querying model status
- **Use Cases**: Health checks, version verification, debugging

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests added in `tests/test_torchserve_client.py`:
- Health check functionality and caching
- Circuit breaker behavior
- Retry logic with mocked failures
- Batch processing with size limits
- Input validation
- Metrics recording
- Context manager functionality

## Monitoring

Grafana dashboard configuration provided in `monitoring/torchserve_dashboard.json`:
- Connection status visualization
- Request rate by status
- Latency percentiles (P95, P99)
- Circuit breaker trips
- Retry rates
- Error rates

Alerting rules configured for:
- TorchServe connection down
- High error rates (>10%)
- Circuit breaker activation
- High latency (P95 > 5s)

## Production Deployment

Complete deployment guide in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` covering:
- Infrastructure requirements
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Security configuration (TLS, network policies)
- Performance tuning settings
- High availability setup
- Monitoring and alerting
- Deployment checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

## Usage Example

```python
# The client automatically uses all production features
from app.models import classifier

# Single classification with all protections
result = await classifier.classify("How do I implement a REST API?")

# Batch classification with size limiting
results = await classifier.batch_classify(texts)

# Health status check
is_healthy = classifier.torchserve_client.is_healthy()
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging environment for integration testing
2. Load test to verify circuit breaker thresholds
3. Configure monitoring dashboards in Grafana
4. Set up PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
5. Document runbooks for common issues
