# Enhancement Endpoint Fix Summary

## Problem
The technique selector client was experiencing validation errors due to complexity field value mismatches. The technique selector service requires the complexity field to be one of exactly: "simple", "moderate", or "complex", but the intent classifier might return different values.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Complexity Normalization
Added a `normalizeComplexity` function in `internal/services/clients.go` that:
- Maps various complexity values to the valid ones
- Handles case-insensitive matching
- Provides sensible aliases:
  - "simple": low, easy, basic
  - "moderate": medium, intermediate  
  - "complex": high, hard, difficult, advanced
- Defaults unknown values to "moderate"

### 2. Validation at Multiple Levels
- **Intent Classifier Response**: Added validation to ensure complexity values are valid after classification
- **Technique Selector Request**: Normalizes complexity before sending to technique selector service
- **Fallback Protection**: Defaults to "moderate" for any invalid/unknown complexity values

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed request/response logging for debugging
- Logs the full request body and URL when sending to technique selector
- Logs error responses with full context for troubleshooting

### 4. Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive unit tests for complexity normalization
- Added integration test structure for the enhance endpoint
- Created mock intent classifier for consistent testing
- Developed E2E test scripts for validation

## Files Modified
1. `internal/services/clients.go` - Added normalization and validation
2. `internal/handlers/enhance_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `internal/services/normalization_test.go` - Unit tests for normalization
4. `internal/services/mock_intent_classifier.go` - Mock for testing
5. `e2e_test.sh` - End-to-end validation script

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd backend/services/api-gateway
go test -v ./internal/services/normalization_test.go
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
cd backend/services/api-gateway
./e2e_test.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test enhancement with various complexity inputs
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/enhance \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "How do I write a good React component?"}'
```

## Next Steps
1. Ensure all services are running with docker compose
2. Run the E2E test script to validate the full enhancement flow
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding complexity normalization to the intent classifier service itself

## Benefits
- **Robustness**: System now handles various complexity value formats
- **Compatibility**: Works with different intent classifier implementations
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging makes troubleshooting easier
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
