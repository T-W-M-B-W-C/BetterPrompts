# ML Services Fix Verification Report

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Original Issue**: KeyError: 'suggested_techniques' causing "Failed to analyze intent" errors

**Root Cause**: The adaptive router's hybrid classifier wasn't returning the required 'suggested_techniques' field

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Endpoint Protection (intents.py)
```python
# Line 95: Added default value
suggested_techniques=result.get("suggested_techniques", ["chain_of_thought"])
```

### 2. Adaptive Router Enhancement (adaptive_router.py)
```python
# Lines 379-384: Ensure field exists
if "suggested_techniques" not in result:
    intent = result.get("intent", "unknown")
    result["suggested_techniques"] = self._get_default_techniques(intent)

# Lines 420-434: Added technique mapping method
def _get_default_techniques(self, intent: str) -> List[str]:
    technique_mapping = {
        "question_answering": ["analogical_reasoning", "step_by_step", "few_shot"],
        "code_generation": ["chain_of_thought", "few_shot", "self_consistency"],
        # ... other mappings
    }
```

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Code Generation Request
- **Input**: "Write a function to sort an array"
- **Result**: ✅ Success
- **Model Used**: zero_shot (Wave 6 adaptive routing)
- **Response Time**: 4.8 seconds
- **Confidence**: 0.717
- **Techniques**: ["step_by_step"]

### Test 2: Question Answering Request
- **Input**: "Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old"
- **Result**: ✅ Success
- **Model Used**: rules (Wave 6 adaptive routing)
- **Response Time**: 0.04 seconds
- **Confidence**: 0.233
- **Techniques**: ["zero_shot"]

## Wave 6 Adaptive Routing Performance

The system is correctly using the Wave 6 adaptive router to intelligently select models:

1. **High-complexity tasks** → Zero-shot model (higher accuracy, slower)
2. **Simple pattern matches** → Rules model (faster, lower confidence acceptable)

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

1. **Model Initialization**: The 4-5 second latency for zero-shot classification suggests models are being loaded per-request. Consider implementing model preloading.

2. **Caching**: Enable caching for frequently requested intents to reduce latency.

3. **TorchServe**: While currently disabled, enabling TorchServe with proper model deployment could improve performance for complex classifications.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The ML services are now functioning correctly with proper error handling and intelligent model routing.
